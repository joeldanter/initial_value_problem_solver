# Initial value problem solver

- This is a collection of dynamic systems, described by their differential equations, and a collection of initial value problem solvers that can be paired in any combination. This is achieved by abstracting the systems to include a function which computes the derivative of the state vector with respect to time, given the current state vector.
- Should have written this in C++

## Installation
